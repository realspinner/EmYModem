# EmYModem
Implementation of XMODEM/YMODEM protocol, designed for embedded devices with RTOS.

## What is this?
The goal of the project is to create a set of classes and interfaces for complete implementation of XMODEM and YMODEM protocols, suitable for memory-constrained embedded devices. It has zero hardware or software dependencies, so coud be easily adopted into virtually any project.
